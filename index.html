            <p>When learning JavaScript, many beginners can get hit with unexpected CORS errors. They need to practice
                fetch, GET, PULL promises, async/await. Most tutorials use API's/endpoints that allow CORS.</p>
            <p>Many new programmers, after following a
                tutorial or two, will want to choose a real API to practice their skills. They do exactly what they
                learned, but encounter CORS errors. Programmers will understandably want to practice their new skills on
                their own, and may likely choose to
                practice with an API that they have found, <i>that doesn't allow CORS</i>. </p>
            <p>If this sounds familiar, you may have done some research already, you will likely have found out that
                browsers do not allow fetching of most
                datatypes, unless they come from the same origin and port. You may also learn that you need to change
                the server settings to allow
                CORS on the backend. But this API is not yours, so you can't set the server to <code
                    class="inline-snip">allow-cors</code>!
            </p>
            <p>In many real-world environments, the website and backend server likely exist on the same url. That allows
                information to be
                fetched from external sources, because CORS restrictions exist for browsers, not for backends. And the
                server will do all of the external fetches. Note that this is my interpretation, and this may be
                inaccurate.</p>
            <p>The CORS-Fixer software is a simple program, which was created to extract the complication for beginners,
                just wanting to practice, who do not own the API endpoint. Simply put it will allow you to fetch safely
                from external sources, and avoid the headaches that come with CORS. It uses a small, simple Express
                server and Node to make fetches for you. It's pretty fast to set up, and the
                entire process will be explained, step by step. This is designed for people relatively new to
                javascript, so most of this will hopefully be easy to follow and understand what's going on. Feel free
                to find out more about CORS on your own, the
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">MDN Site</a> is a great place to dig
                into the matter.

            <p><em><i>NOTE!:</i></em>The file structure must be identical or the program and tutorial will not work!</p>
            <p>The folder structure must be as follows (although you don't need the .gitignore, license, and

            <p>Next you need to open a terminal, and navigate to the main folder, which is whatever you chose to
                name
                it. If you are unsure about how to do this, read the <a href="#command-line-article">article
                    mentioned
                    above.</a> Here you need to be sure that you are in the main project folder, whatever you named
                it if you copied the files. If you forked or cloned it, this will be the easy-cors-fix folder.</p>
            <p>Once <i>you are sure that you are inside of the main project folder</i>, type the following command:
                in at your command line console: <code class="inline-snip">npm install</code></p>
            <p>If all goes well, npm will install the dependencies your project needs ( only express & node-fetch), You
                will see several messages in the console. Some will say NPM: Warn. In most instances you will not need
                to concerned with "warn" unless you see "error" somewhere. Near the end of the output in the console you
                should see a line similar to<br />
                <code
                    class="full-line-snip">added 54 packages from 41 contributors and audited 54 packages in 3.411s</code>
                Additionally you will now have a new folder, called node_modules. Ignore it, it's outside the scope
                of this documentation, and you should never modify files in this folder anyways.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="starting_the_server">
            <header>starting the server</header>
            <p>You are now ready to start the server. If you are familiar with nodemon, use it instead of node. Before
                the server is started it is important to point out that it will not "hot reload," unless you use
                Nodemon. If you are unfamiliar with this, don't worry about it. What's important and that you need to
                know is that after you start the server in the commands detailed below, the server will continue running
                until you stop it. However, if you make a change to the server.js file, nothing will happen.</p>
            <p>So it is important to remember that <highlight>when you are finished making changes to the server.js file
                    you have to stop the server and restart it.</highlight> You do this by pressing <code
                    class="inline-snip">Ctrl + C (Cmd + C on mac)</code>
                <highlight>twice!</highlight>And then you will to restart the server with the command discussed below.
            </p>
            <p>Navigate to the server folder, then enter the following 2
                commands: First <code class="inline-snip">cd server</code>.</p>

            <p>You should now be in the server folder. Note that your path in the terminal should be something similar
                to C:\...YOURPATH...\server. Everyone's will be different but what's important is that the path ends in
                <highlight>\server</highlight>. Then enter the <code class="inline-snip">node server.js</code> or the
                nodemon equivalent in at the command line.
            </p>
            <p>The server will start serving a small webpage. If successful, you will see two messages in the command
                line, the second of which will be <code
                    class="full-line-snip">Test server is running on port 3000</code>
                This should also open a page in your default browser automatically. If not, open your favorite browser
                and
                navigate to <code class="inline-snip">http://localhost:3000</code>. You should see a simple webpage like
                the one below.
            </p>
            <p class="tip">Tip: If you are viewing this page on a PC, and if you hover over an image, it will automatically widen
                to the entire width of the page. This will help cut down on zooming in and out constantly if your vision
                is not perfect. If you find it terribly annoying, just take the mouse off of the picture and it will
                return to normal size.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="short_server.js_description">
            <header>short server.js description</header>
            <p>A full explanation of the server file is included at the end of these documents. But for right now, all
                that you must know about the server file, is that when you give the Node command to start the server, it
                is configured to automatically serve a file called index.html in the public folder.</p>
            <p>In addition, two endpoints were added to the server file. As long as the server is running, <i>(don't try
                    this just yet will, we will do this in the next section)</i> and you type
                <code class="inline-snip">http://localhost:3000/returnSomeJSON</code> into the browser, the browser will
                receive a small
                dummy data file
            </p>
            <p>If you type <code class="inline-snip">http://localhost:3000/nodehttp</code>, this leads to the endpoint
                which we will use
                to fetch from an external API, without invoking CORS (remember, servers do not have CORS
                restrictions,
                only
                browsers).</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="the_app.js_file">
            <header>the app.js file</header>
            <p>Here you have an option, you may just follow along with the description of what is happening, when the
                connection to the Vinmonopolet API is described, and then afterwards test your own API, after you
                understand
                the process. </p>
            <p>Alternatively, you can get an API key yourself and follow along. To get a key navigate to <a
                    href="https://api.vinmonopolet.no/signup">https://api.vinmonopolet.no/signup</a>. After registering
                you will receive an email with 2 api keys. Just use the primary key at the point that you need it.</p>
            <p>Note that here we will first just <em><i>plug in the necessary stuff, make it work, and see how to add a
                        query</i></em> in this section. What is happening and why will be explained in the next section.
            </p>

            <p>First we will just test the server, with some dummy json information. In the address, at the top of your
                browser, which should be at http://localhost:3000, add <code class="inline-snip">/returnSomeJSON</code>
                (case-sensitive), to the end, so
                that the address is now: http://localhost:3000/returnSomeJSON. Note that JSON is in all
                caps.</p>
            <p>You should see some dummy information returned from the server:</p>
            <img src="./img/json.jpg" alt="screenshot of a json object, that contains two dummy objects">
            <p>Press the back button on the browser and you should see the input box and the button. Press the submit
                button. Open your browser's console (<code class="inline-snip">ctrl + shift + i</code> on windows), and
                you will see 4 different items
                being logged. These are all originating from within app.js. The last log, after submitted, is the same
                dummy object we saw before pictured above, it's just now being logged into the console. This gives you
                an idea of how to get json data and be able to work with it.</p>
            <p>The last line of code in the app.js file is an event listener, tied to the form submission that calls the
                testFunction() function in the app file. testFunction() is just a standard asynchronous fetch.</p>
            <p>Now change the last line of the app to: <code
                    class="full-line-snip">form.addEventListener('submit', sendFetchViaServer)</code>
                This is app is now trying to fetch data from an external source. <highlight>By design, this doesn't work
                    yet.</highlight> This
                is so that you can see the status code, returned from the external API. </p>
            <p>You can see this in 2 places.
                This is logged in your (NODE) terminal, and should just state <code
                    class="inline-snip">statusCode: 401.</code> If you open the <i>browser</i>
                console, you should see an object that begins with
                <code
                    class="inline-snip">{statusCode: 401, message: 'Access denied due to invalid subscription key</code>...etc.
            </p>
            <p>If you are just following along the two outputs are shown in the following picture, the node terminal is
                shown on the left, and the browser console is shown on the right. We will fix the 401 error next.</p>
            <img src="./img/401node.jpeg" alt="screenshot showing a compiler and a browser with the console opened. Both show a 401 status code. The browser status code is part of a larger object with details from the response"/>
            <p>The error was occuring because we don't have a valid api key for the external vinmonopolet API. If you
                decided to get your own key, you will need to find the line in the server.js file, in the options header
                that looks like: <code class="inline-snip">'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': 'YOUR API KEY HERE'</code>.</p>
            <p> Remove: YOUR
                API KEY HERE, and replace it with your api key. Note that you need to leave the quotes ' ', and put your
                key inside like so '123fakekey1B2u3L4L5s6h7I8T'. If you don't it won't work.</p>
            <p class="tip"><em><i>Important! Here you
                        must stop the server (ctrl +c), and restart it with the same node server.js command!</i></em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If successful, after you save your changes, when you push the submit button in the browser, you should
                now see that the status code in the Node terminal is now 200. And in the browser console, and if you
                click and
                open the array right after <code class="inline-snip">data is</code>, it now contains a dataset as shown
                in the picture
                below.</p>
            <img src="./img/200.jpg">
            <p>You have now successfully gotten around the CORS problems, and have a working model that you can use to
                test. But, there are things working behind the scenes that you need to know before you can test a
                different API. The most obvious and necessary is how to use a query, and how to set up your headers,
                which will be discussed in the next two sections.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="the_query">
            <header>the query</header>
            <p>So typically when you go to an external API, you want to get some data in return. Most of the time you
                will be searching/querying for something in particular. For example you may be looking for an item in
                the products dataset with an id of 35. Or all cars that have the color yellow. This is where you will
                begin to need to customize your own fetch, based on your needs. You will have to decide how to make your
                own query string fit the API that you want to use. But it helps by looking at our example, and we will
                use it to test this.</p>
            <p>Before when we sent a successful fetch, we had not discussed how this is happening. What is happening is that when you added
                <code class="inline-snip">/nodehttp</code> to your url, the browser redirected to a url that was in the server. A new page did not load,
                becuase the endpoint is not set up for this (although it is possible if you want to). Instead what
                happened is that a method in the server fetched external data, and returned it to app.js, where it logs
                to the console as directed, at this line <code class="inline-snip">console.log('data is',data)</code> </p>
            <p>That data is being returned from a method in the server file that begins with
                <code class="inline-snip">app.get('/nodehttp', ....</code>
            </p>
            <p>For now, let's just focus on the function fetchData(). This code is very similar to a javascript fetch, Node is indeed written in javascript. Just note that there are some subtle differences. For example, you have to import http or https into node, both of which I have already imported.</p>
            <pre>            <code class="javascript">    const fetchData = () => {
                https.get('https://apis.vinmonopolet.no/stores/v0/details?storeNameContains=holmen', options, (res) => {
                    console.log('statusCode:', res.statusCode);
        
                    res.on('data', (d) => {
                        // process.stdout.write(d); //use this if you need to log the response from the external api, note that it logs in the terminal and not the browser console
                        handleData(d)
                    });
        
                }).on('error', (e) => {
                    console.error(e);
                });
            }</code></pre>

            <p>The data that was fetched is being fetched from the external API on this url
            <code class="full-line-snip">https://apis.vinmonopolet.no/stores/v0/details?storeNameContains=holmen</code>
            The last part, <code class="inline-snip">...?storeNameContains=holmen</code> is the query string. It is asking the external
                API to return stores whose names contain the string holmen. The only way to know that you should query
                using "?storeNameContains=" is to read the documentation on the API. This particular API doesn't have
                much documentation, but it has a section where you can test query the API from your browser. You can see
                both the request and response, in several formats, like javascript, python, curl, etc. </p>
            <p id="small-screen-break">You can try that at this page, <a
                    href="https://api.vinmonopolet.no/api-details#api=stores&operation=GET_DETAILS">https://api.vinmonopolet.no/api-details#api=stores&operation=GET_DETAILS</a>.
                <i class="tip">Note that if you are not logged in that you will get a 404 request denied response after you press
                    the try it button.</i> If you want to test other cities, you can enter "sandvika" in the
                storeNameContainsField for a single result, or "oslo" for a dataset with 33 stores. You can also change
                the query to ...<code class="inline-snip">?storeId=something</code> and search for a number. I just used "Holmen" because it
                is my favorite local store where I buy my wine, and searched by the name of the store.
            </p>
            <p>For this example we only search using ...<code class="inline-snip">?storeNameContains=SOMETHING</code>, and focus on making
                the SOMETHING to whatever is entered in our browser input. For simplicity the value in the input box has
                already been set up on the input variable in the app.js file.</p>
            <p>To accomplish this we will have to first concatenate that information into the url that we send to our
                server. Then we have to adjust the server code to include it in the url used in the real external fetch.
            </p>
            <p>In the app.js file, change the sendFetchViaServer() function so that it now looks like:</p><br />
            <pre>            <code>
                const sendFetchViaServer =(e)=>{
                    e.preventDefault()
                    const input = document.getElementById('main-input').value
                    const url = `http://localhost:3000/nodehttp?searchingFor=${input}`
                    ///use this input above to  manipulate the query below
                    console.log('input: ', input);
                    console.log('here we go')
                    fetch(url).then((response)=> {
                      response.json().then((data)=> {
                        console.log('data is',data)
                      })
                    })
                  }
            </code></pre>
            <p>We have done two things here, we have placed the URL into a variable, and we are adding the input to the
                end of the url.</p>
            <p>We have also decided to call our query searchingFor, although we could have called it kittens, it doesn't
                matter. What matters is that the ? query symbol is followed by a key and a value. In this case the key
                is whatever (searchingFor), and after the = sign this value will be whatever letters are in the input
                box.</p>
            <p>If you don't understand what is going on here:
                <code class="full-line-snip">const url = `http://localhost:3000/nodehttp?searchingFor=${input}`</code> this is equivalent to:
            <code class="full-line-snip">const url = 'http://localhost:3000/nodehttp?searchingFor='<br />
                url += input</code>
            <p>You have now successfully passed the input that is in the box, to your server so it can use it to search
                the external api. If you save changes, this will not work yet, because we also have to make some small
                adjustments on the server to receive the search term and forward it to the external API.</p>
            <p>Over in the server.js file, it will now receive your data. If you uncomment out the line
                <code class="inline-snip">console.log('req.query: ', req.query);</code>, then type something in the input, and submit it,
                you will see it the node console, as shown below.</p>
                <p class="tip">But first, remember to restart the server! ;)</p>
            <img src="./img/query.jpg">
            <p>The app.js is passing a request.query property which in this case is an
                object with a key value pair. In this case <code class="inline-snip">{ searchingFor: 'holmen' }</code>. The 'holmen' bit
                will be whatever you have entered in the input in the browser.
            </p>
            <p>So now you can access this value on req.query.searchingFor. Note if you previously named it something
                else like kittens, then it will be available on req.query.kittens. You change the url in the server.js,
                like you changed the url in app.js, and it will dynamically fetch whatever you search for...but wait!
                You won't be able to access req.query.searchingFor inside of the fetchData function in server.js. It
                will be undefined because it is outside of it's scope. There are several approaches to how to fix this,
                but since you haven't got the explanation for the server code, it is best to follow this approach. We
                will concatenate the url like we did in app.js, but we have to pass it to fetchData.</p>
            <p>The <code class="inline-snip">app.get('/nodehttp'</code> method is already setup to where it calls fetchData after it is
                declared. So we just need to concatenate the url where we CAN access req.query.searchingFor, and then
                pass it to fetchData(). For simplicity the entire method, app.get(/nodehttp .. is included below.</p>
                <p class="tip">Note: if you copy and paste the code in, you must change 'YOUR-API-KEY-HERE' to your key, just as you
                    did before.</p>

            <p>You can now successfully avoid a CORS problem, on the example vinmonopolet API. Try searching for
                'sandvika' and checking that the console is now logging information about the sandvika store. Great! But
                before you can successfully implement this with your chosen API, you must understand headers, which is
                addressed in the next section.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="headers">
            <header>headers</header>
            <p>When you are ready to test this on the external API of your choice, you are all but ready, except for
                headers. Unfortunately, the headers needed by other API's will vary from the ones that the example API
                used. If you are lucky they will explain which headers are needed in the API documentation.</p>

            <p>The vinmonopolet API documentation doesn't really have a text explanation of which headers can and must
                be used. This is likely true of many real-world, non test APIS. You may be able to send an email and ask
                how to do it, and if you're lucky, you might get a response. In the case of the example API, in order to
                figure out which headers were needed, I was able to look at the example requests on the website; see the
                right side of the picture below.</p>
            <img src="./img/headers.jpg" />
            <p>Unfortunately, if you don't send the right headers, it will not work with your API. Additionally, if you
                send the wrong headers, this may result in a CORS error. When using fetch I found it was much easier to
                just declare an options object, that contains a header object, as shown below. I say this because I have
                spent a bit of time on it, and this is the only way I could both make it work, and also understand what I was
                doing. </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                const options = {
                    headers: {
                        'whatever': 'whatever',
                        'token': 'whatever'
                    }
                };
            </code></pre>
            <p>If you do have some headers that you want to try, just plug them in the object as key/value pairs and try
                it on the API you have chosen.
            </p>
            <p>FYI: This options object is passed to the external API here
                <code class="inline-snip">https.get(url, options, (res) =></code>. Try to send the right headers to your API. If you have a
                problem, you may be able to figure out what is happening by reading the response. The status code is
                already being logged in the Node Terminal.<code class="inline-snip">console.log('statusCode:', res.statusCode)</code>. You
                can add another log on the next line, like: <code class="inline-snip">
                console.log('response headers', res.headers)</code>.</p>
                <p> This should give you an idea of what is happening, even
                if you are not a master of headers. Note that if you are unlucky enough to create a CORS error by
                sending the wrong header, you may not get much information in the response.
            </p>
            <p>You can also try emptying the options object, like so: <code class="inline-snip">const options = {}</code>. However most real
                API's want some form of identification key. If you figure out what they call it like access-token, or
                Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key like the example API uses, you can try sending the options object like it is
                shown below, just replace 'token' with whatever they call their key, and put the key in the right side.
            </p>
<pre>
    <code>
                    const options = {
                        headers: {
                            'token': 'xzyTIHSLLUB1243'
                        }
                    };
                </code>
    </pre>
            <p>Unfortunately, I cannot guide you any further, because all API's are different, but if you know the
                headers/authentication required, this program will help you to practice, without spending days pulling
                your hair out because of CORS errors. If you have followed along this far successfully, figuring out how to add headers will not be a great challenge. Most likely the greatest challenge will be figuring out what headers your API of choice needs.</p>
